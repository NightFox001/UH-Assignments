This exam is closed book.  You can have one page of notes.
     
1.   Consider the following program:
  
          main(){
               if (fork() == 0) fork();
          } // main

     How many processes will it fork?

     (a)  One process.
 *** (b)  Two processes. (Child and process forked by child)        
     (c)  Three processes.
     (d)  Four processes.

2.   What are the advantages of the master/slave organization for
     multiprocessor operating systems?

     (a)  It requires fewer context switches. (Not True)
 *** (b)  It requires fewer modifications to the kernel.
     (c)  Both (a) and (b).
     (d)  None of the above.

3.   Which of these events can move a process from the running state
     to the ready state?

     (b)  A time-out interrupt.
 *** (c)  Both (a) and (b).
     (d)  None of the above.

4.   Which of the following statements apply to the round-robin
     scheduling policy?

     (a)  It can cause starvation. (False since all processes have
          the same priority
 *** (b)  It uses the same time slice for all processes.
     (c)  Both (a) and (b).
     (d)  None of the above.

     (b)  They are slower than microkernels.
     (c)  Both (a) and (b).

8.   In a multiprogramming system, there may be many programs but
     there is only a single process at any time.
     (a)  TRUE
 *** (b)  FALSE (Otherwise the ready queue would always be empty.)

9.   What is the major cause for the lack of success of layered
     kernels?

          even though they are many layers, there are all in the
          kernel)
 *** (b)  It is very difficult to partition a kernel into
          hierarchical layers.
     (c)  Both (a) and (b).

          are likely to be rewarded.)
)
14.  What is the major advantage of using kernel-supported threads
     instead of user-level threads?
     (a)  We will have fewer context switches.
     (b)  Kernel-supported threads share the address space of their parent.
 *** (c)  Blocking system calls do not block all threads in the caller's
          address space.
     (d)  None of the above.

15.  What is the major advantage of the symmetric approach in
     operating systems for multiprocessor architectures?

 *** (b)  getenv("HOME") (As you should know from the assignment.)
     (c)  access()
     (d)  pwd()
     (e)  chdir()

Consider the following system V.4 scheduler, to which the four next
questions will refer:

     #ts_quantum ts_tqexp ts_slpret ts_maxwait ts_lwait LEVEL
          800        X        1       16000        1    #  0

17.  The sole correct value for the variable X is:

**** (a)  0 (A process exceeding its quantum will stay at level
          0 because there is no lower level.)
     (b)  1
     (c)  2
     (d)  3
     (e)  4

18.  The sole correct value for the variable Y is:

19.  The sole correct value for the variable Z is:

     (a)  0
     (b)  1
     (c)  2
 *** (d)  3 (A process returning from the waiting state should
          stay at priority level 3 because this is already the
          highest priority level.)
     (e)  4

20.  The sleep in ts_slpret refers to:

     (a)  The ready state.
 *** (b)  The waiting state.
     (c)  The ready_suspended state.

          close(2);
          dup(fd);
          close(1);
          dup(fd);

     (a)  stderr is redirected to the file "logfile".
     (b)  stdout is redirected to the file "logfile".
 *** (c)  Both (a) and (b).
     (d)  None of the above.

23.  Memory protection:

 *** (a)  Prevents processes from accessing data located in the
          address spaces of other processes.
     (b)  Prevents processes from directly accessing the disk.
          (No that's what privileged instructions are for.)
     (c)  Both (a) and (b).
     (d)  None of the above.

24.  A process that relinquishes the CPU after it has exhausted its
     time slice goes to the waiting state.

     (a)  TRUE
 *** (b)  FALSE (It returns to the ready queue).

25.  Anticipating read requests reduces the number of disk accesses
     but:

     (a)  May result in lost data if the system suddenly crashes.
     (b)  Increases the number of context switches.
     (c)  Both (a) and (b).
 *** (d)  None of the above. ((a) and (b) apply to delaying
          writes.)
 
26.  Which default action is performed by a UNIX process when it
     receives a signal?
     (a)  The process ignores the signal.
 *** (b)  The process terminates.
     (c)  The process handles the signal according to the

     (d)  None of the above.

27.  In a vectorized interrupt system, an interrupt can only be
     interrupted by an interrupt of equal or higher priority.
     (a)  TRUE
 *** (b)  FALSE (Only by a higher priority interrupt.)

28.  Why should we reduce the CPU time slice of a round robin policy
     when the workload increases?

 *** (a)  To keep a reasonable response time for interactive
          processes.
     (b)  To reduce the number of context switches. (Opposite effect.)
     (c)  Both (a) and (b).
     (d)  None of the above.

29.  Too many processes in the ready queue is a good indication that:

     (a)  The system may need more memory.

     (c)  Both (a) and (b).
     (d)  None of the above.
