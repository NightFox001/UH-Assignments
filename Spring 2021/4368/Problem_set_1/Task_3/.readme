# Problem set 1 - Task 3

This project requires main.py func.py and constraints.py to be together in the same workspace/folder/dir for full functionality
proofs.py is included to help you visiulize some of the proofs working if you want to see it.

## This entire project was built with 2 main goals in mind
1. Make nva as small as possible
2. Make everything as easy as possible for others to understand and hopefully learn something new

# Quick start on how to use
1. run main.py
2. enter 'a', 'b', or 'c'
doing this will automatically run the lastest version of a function to solve that problem

## Extra usability
I encluded multiple versions of each solution. This is so you can see how I started solving the problem 'aV1()' and what changes/optimazation I made, and in what order over time 'aV2()' 'aV3()' 'aV3()' ect.
There are 6 versions of function a, 5 for b, and 4 for c. You may run an older version of a solution to see progression of results by navigating to this folder 'task_3' in terminal and typing the command 'python main.py' followed by a1-6 or b1-5 or c1-4. for example
```
python main.py a4
or
python main.py a6
or
python main.py b4
or
python main.py c2
```

This project was also built with maintainability and reusability in mind. The constraints.py file demonstrates this. When solving problem
